## nth-derivative

This is a utility which can be use to determine the derivative of a Mathematical function `f(x)`. 

It is aslo detects `GENERAL nth DERIVATIVE FORMULA` and gives you the general formula. 

Small utility to work with nth derivatives (example script: `nth_derivative.py`).

Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- sympy

Quick start

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies (SymPy):

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install sympy
```

3. Run the example script:

```bash
python nth_derivative.py
```
